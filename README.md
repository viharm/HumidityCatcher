*pyHumiTemp* is a script to capture numeric humidity and temperature output from DHT22.


## Installation


### Pre-requisites

* *DHT22* humidity and temperature sensor
* ***tango*** binary (http://blog.e-photographer.net/?p=927) to interrogate *DHT22*
* Hardware drivers for *DHT22* specific to the platform


### Download

Download the script as an archive, clone as a *Git* repository and install with *pip* from *PyPI*


#### Archive

Download archive of the latest version from https://github.com/viharm/pyHumiTemp/releases/latest.


### PyPI

From version v1.0.1 onwards, *pyHumiTemp* is available on *[PyPI](https://pypi.org/)* and can be installed with *pip* (or *pip3*)

```

```
git clone https://github.com/viharm/pyHumiTemp.git
```


### Deploy

No specific deployment requirements.


## Configuration

No configuration necessary.


## Usage

Simply run the script and pass the required quantity to be measured as a parameter


### Temperature

```
/usr/bin/python3 DHT22.py --param=temperature
```


### Humidity

```
/usr/bin/python3 DHT22.py --param=humidity
